# The state of corporate design @ STAT ZH

???

This presentation is about 'mastering CD'. However by mastering CD i do not mean perfectly layout and format everything and investing a lot of resources to do so. It is about achieving visual consistence of different forms of publications by letting R do the job for you. We will present the functions & templates we have programmed in R that users will not use for the sake of complying with CD at any cost but for CONVENIENCE.

#The state of CD @ <font color=#009ee0>STAT ZH</font>

- Generic CD Guidelines for cantonal public administration cover the basics (e.g. fonts)
- No centralized publishing, several self-publishers
 - Infographics (Website & Twitter), Excel-Tables, statistik.info
 
- professionaly layouted publications are the exception

- How do we achieve <b>visual uniformity</b> of our products?

--

- <b>'Do it yourself' Corporate Design Toolbox</b>


???

The generic CD Guidelines provide a plenty of freedoms when it comes to design  - especially to units that publish data-products. We at the statistical Office have no centralized publishing. We are a group of self-publishers that produce infographics, Excel-tables and pdf-publications. So given this situation, how do we achieve a high degree of visual unifomirty? We are building a Corporate Desing Toolbox for this purpouse.

# ZH Colour Palette

Not the ideal <font color=#009ee0>color-palette</font> for graphs.
```{r tidy=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(statR)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill=clarity))+ 
  geom_bar(position = "stack", width = 1)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=zhpal$zhcd)

```


???
The official cantonal CD-colors were made for other purpouses than data-visualization - mainly for the use in print publications produced with office products. Which explains why the palette is like it is.

### How we created our own color-scheme

- **Color palette creation** with R
 - Mute the cd colors (color interpolation)
 - Adapt the color space (LAB instead of RGB)
 - Creation of a color-matrix (varying hue AND saturation)
 - Testing for Colorblind-friendliness
 
## Resources
 
**Interpolation** → grDevices::colorRampPalette()

**Colorblind-Testing** → [Dichromat-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dichromat/index.html)

???

Everyone was using his own palettes (mainly color brewer) - no consistence! So we decided to develop our own color scheme. Here you can see the steps of the color-sheme developemnt. We took the cd-colors, reorderer and muted them. Of course, we've adapted the colorspace to LAB instead of RGB. LAB is a color space that is optimized for the human eye better percevieng the different hues. Then i wrote a function on top of the colorRampPalette-Function that you can feed with a palette and it produces differently saturated (lighter and darker) versions of it, in equal steps. The result is a color matrix which you can see on the next slide.

```{r tidy=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(statR)
library(scales)

show_col(c(zhpal$zhdarker,zhpal$zhdark,zhpal$zh,zhpal$zhlight,zhpal$zhpastel,zhpal$zhextralight,zhpal$zhultralight), borders=FALSE)
```


---
class: center,middle


.pull-left[
```{r tidy=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
p = ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill=cut)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack", width= 0.5)

p +theme_stat() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=zhpal$zhdiagonal)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r tidy=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
library(dichromat)

p +theme_stat() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=dichromat(zhpal$zhdiagonal,type=c("tritan")))
```
]

???
If you should ever create your own palette you will have it tested for colorblindness.
The dichromat package is a great resource. You can see an example here.

the second element in our toolbox is a ggplot2-theme. As with the colours - before everyone was playing around with theme options and you would reckognize who did a chart by how it looked.

# Producing already formated XLSX-tables with R


???

I would never have imagined to give a presentation related to EXCEL at an R-conference. But here i am. I will try to make it short. We're in this toghether and will survive it for sure. Just think about the lunch break soon. 
However i have to admit that it appears to be possible to do crazy stuff in Excel - i mean look at this gif that i found on reddit. Someone has programemd this in excel!

## Our users love Excel-tables
100+ Excel-tables on our website<br>
Data is delivered in Excel-tables to users on a daily-basis<br>
No strict guidelines on how XLSX files should look like

.footnote[[<font color=#FFFFFF>Gif: Hoguemr, reddit<font>](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1gzksk/work_was_a_little_slow_for_me_this_morning_again/)]

???

The majority of our customers relies on Excel as a tool for data analysis. Thats why we have 100+ excel Tables on our website. We perform customer specific queries on a daily basis and deliver the data in Excel-tables. However there is a problem with this - for a long time, there haven't been any strict guidelines on how our XLSX Files should look like.

Be warned the next slide -> headache. How diverse our excels looked like (and to some degree still do)

#statXLSX

Creating formated excel-tables straight-out-of-R saves time and reduces the risk of errors. We recurred to the [***openxlsx-package***](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openxlsx/openxlsx.pdf) package to define functions that write R-datasets in formated STAT ZH-Excel-tables.

***single worksheet***
statR::quickXLSX(data,"name of the table")

***multiple worksheets***
statR::splitXLSX(data,"name of the table", sheetvar)

***Advantages***

+End-to-end reproducibility

+quality assurance, less error prone

+visual coherence

???
The amount of time i spend with formatting excel-tables at work is directly correlated with job-dissatisfaction. i love my job. And to assure that this stays as it is i wrote these functions. There are several packages that allow to create xlsx files. I choose to build the functions on top of the openxlsx package. openxlsx does not dependend on Java, which has caused me trouble when using other excel-packages. 

We are automatizing the Excel-production and the functions are coming into play in this process.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.set up a RMarkdown file in RStudio render it with some tex-compiler through kniter and get the pdf. How can you custommize your pdf output? -> YAML header

???
let's get a bit deeper in the technical details. we see here a yaml header of a random RMarkdown file. In the yaml header you define your output type, pdf, html, word, whatever. according to the output section this file is going to produce a PDF document. furthermore, we have specified a latex_engine xelatex (necessary for arial fonts) and a cairo_pdf device for the graphics output. probably, we wish to make further adjustments to the output. we have (at least) 2 ways of making further customizations. Probably you may want do make adjustments to the default .tex layout. like font, colors, title page etc. 2 ways of doing this: 
- in the header-includes: you can do the tex-adjustments, loading packages, define colors etc.
- you create you own my_template.tex and overwrite rmarkdowns default .tex file 

statRmd is, as you have seen, a package containing templates and helper functions  (for example to nicely align the graphics output in the document or to nicely wrap plot titles ). I'll just show how it works.

#  Conclusion

__What we have achieved with our CD-Toolbox__
 
- drastic reduction of time spent for repetitive tasks

- setting of CD-standards through convenience (not by 'force'!)

- end-to-end reproducibilty of the resulting outputs

- gained experience that will help us setting up similar tools & templates for further products / publication channels (e.g. html-pages / shiny-apps)


???

So to draw a conclusion : what have we achieved with our CD-Toolbox? 

We've drastically reduced the time we used to invest in formatting single charts, excel-tables and pdf publications. Also we've factually achieved a much higher degree of visual coherence across our publications - without putting on pressure on people or forcing someone. Just by providing convenient tools! In the areas where the toolbox is at work, we've achieved end - to end reproducibility as well as repeatability. Just execute the code and get the same report again / same excel table with new numbers etc. And last but not least: we've gained experience in creating tools & templates, useful when we will create some for new products / publication channels.
